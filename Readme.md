# Twitch Unfollow Notifier

## Features

- Notify the broadcaster via [Pushbullet](https://pushbullet.com) of the unfollow
- Send a message to the user to ask for improvements (currently only in german and english)
- Support for [Docker](https://docker.com) (contains Dockerfile)

## The configuration

Rename the file `config.json.example` to `config.json` and insert your credentials.

## TODO

- Make the messages customizable
- Improve Readme for a little tutorial (how to get all credentials)
